## üì¶ Getting Started  
  
    
```bash  
  
poetry add ai-engine-sdk  
# or pip install ai-engine-sdk  
```  
  
    
### Using the Chat API  
  
Before you start to integrate the AI Engine into your app, you might want to get familiar with [agent functions](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agents/intermediate/agent-functions).  
  
    
  
#### Creating the AIEngine client object  
  
To find out how to generate an <code>apiKey</code> check out the documentation regarding [Agentverse API keys](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/apis/agent-function-creation-apis).  
  
```python  
from ai_engine_sdk import AiEngine  
ai_engine: AiEngine = AiEngine(api_key)  
  
```  
  
    
#### Querying the id of the function group where our to-be-used function(s) belong  
  
```python  
function_groups: list[FunctionGroup] = await ai_engine.get_function_groups()  
  
public_group = next(  
    (g for g in function_groups if g.name == "Fetch Verified"),    None  
)  
```  
  
If you would like to use the functions in your own **My Functions** function group instead then you can use this filter instead:  
  
```python  
my_group = next(  
    (g for g in function_groups if g.name == "My Functions"),    None  
)  
```  
  

#### Sharing function groups
##### **Purpose**: 
Allow to other users to use `functions`, under a concrete `function-group`, without replicating that `function` or allowing them alter those `functions`  or `funtion-group` data.

##### How to:
If you wish to give access  to a certain `function-group`  (use, not alter the data/state of it), you can use the following method in the following way:

```python
# assuming `ai_engine` is a valid instance of AiEngine

what_function_group_identifier_i_want_share="normally-this-is-an-uuid4"
user_email_i_want_to_share_the_function_group_with = "random@domain.com"
await ai_engine.share_function_group(
	function_group_id=what_function_group_identifier_i_want_share,
	target_user_email=user_email_i_want_to_share_the_function_group_with
)
```

Now, if you were requesting the available `function-groups` for the user with email assigned to the `target_user_email` argument, the `function-group` with the id assigned to `function_group_id`.

You can check that by using the `AiEngine.get_function_groups` method.
#### Creating a session with the AI Engine using the <code>functionGroupId</code> fetched before  
  
```python  
session = await ai_engine.create_session(function_group=public_group.uuid)  
```  
  
    
#### Starting the conversation with an arbitrary objective  
  
```python  
await session.start(objective)
```  
  
    
#### Querying new messages  
  
You might want to query new messages regularly ...  
  
    
  
```python  
  
while True:  
    messages: list[ApiBaseMessage] = await session.get_messages()    # throttling    sleep(3)  
```  
  
    
#### Checking the type of the new message  
  
There are 5 different types of messages which are generated by the AI Engine and the SDK implements methods for checking the type of the respective new <code>Message</code>:  
  
* task selection message: <code>is_task_selection_message</code> - this message is generated for example in the case when the AI engine recommends functions based on the initial objective or in the case when the AI Engine finds multiple options to provide as an input for a function.  
  
* AI Engine message: <code>is_ai_engine_message</code> - this message type doesn't expect the user to reply to, this is for notifying the user about something  
  
* confirmation message: <code>is_confirmation_message</code> - when the AI Engine has managed to acquire all the inputs for the agent belonging to the to-be-executed function (= it has managed to build the context), it sends this type of message to the user  
  
* agent message: <code>is_agent_message</code> - this is a regular question that the user has to reply to with a string  
  
* stop message: <code>is_stop_message</code> - this is the message which is sent when the session has stopped and the AI Engine doesn't wait for any replies from the user  
  
    
  
#### Replying to the different type of messages  
  
All message types (expect for the AI engine message and stop message) expects a response from the user and the SDK implements methods for sending reply in response to those different type of messages respectively.  
  
The first argument of all these reply methods is the <code>Message</code> object to which we want to send back the response.  
  
The SDK methods you can use to reply to:  
  
* task selection message: <code>session.submit_task_selection</code>  
  
* agent message: <code>session.submit_response</code>  
  
* confirmation message: <code>session.submit_confirmation</code> or <code>session.reject_confirmation</code> - depending on if the user wants to confirm or reject the context generated by the AI engine respectively  
  
    
  
#### Deleting session with AI engine  
  
After finishing the conversation with AI Engine you can delete the session like this:  
  
```python  
  
await session.delete()  
  
```
